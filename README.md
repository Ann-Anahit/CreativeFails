# CreativeFails

I encountered many challenges during this project and unfortunately, I didn't have much time to write a Readme. I did manage to hide the secret key somehow, but I'm still having issues with the deployment; the posts page isn't displaying. During this project, I contacted tutor support twice. The first time, I received help, but the second time, I was only advised to follow the workflow and review my code. While it's important to follow the learning materials precisely, sometimes mistakes happen... I didn't want to ask for help again because if the work deviates slightly from the learning materials, it seems like you don't get any assistance. I'm sending you the unfinished work. I'll write the Readme on my second attempt. 

Best regards, Anna Afijan.
